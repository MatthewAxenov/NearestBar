# NearestPlaces

Hello! This is Nearest Places - an app which gives you directions to the nearest places around you 🧭

The app is made using CoreLocation, MKLocalSearch and MapKit 🗺

There are 3 screens in the app: 

1) The first screen has a textField where you can write a place you are searching for and a button which leads you to the next screen

2) The second screen is a navigator to the nearest place you are interested in. It works like a compass with an arrow which gives you the dicrection. You can also see the name of the place and distance to it. The app refreshes the data every 5 seconds
